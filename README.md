How to play with the framework for yourself:
1. Install all the listed requirements in "requirements.txt"
2. Create a 'credentials.json' file in the root directory and add your own Alpha Vantage API key as "av_api_key" : "mykey"
3. Add your own custom parameters in "config.json" (check "run.py" for custom parameters)
4. Run the framework
