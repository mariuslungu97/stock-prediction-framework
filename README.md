How to play with the framework for yourself:
1. Install all the listed requirements in "requirements.txt"
2. Create a 'credentials.json' file in the root directory and add your own Alpha Vantage API key as "av_api_key" : "mykey"
3. Create a "data" directory, with "api_data" and "disk_data" as sub directories
4. Add your own custom parameters in "config.json" (check "run.py" for custom parameters)
5. Run the framework
